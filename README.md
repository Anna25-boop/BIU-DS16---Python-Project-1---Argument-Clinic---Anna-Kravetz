# BIU-DS16---Python-Project-1---Argument-Clinic---Anna-Kravetz
# Greetings,
# In this file I will explain how to use the project and what code to use.
# First of all, you need to copy to notebook the file "BIU-DS16---Python-Project-1---Argument-Clinic---Anna-Kravetz".
# After that you will press "run all" in the settings of notebook colab and the process will begin.
# In this project, you need to insert sentence to the system (clinic) so you ca argue with it.
# the length of the sentence/ question needs to be between 2 to 10 words, and you can't have numerical values 
# in the words themselfs. To all the questions and sentences the clinic will give an answer.
# Sometimes it will be random and sometimes the answers are planned by me.
# Also the system counting time, so the customer can insert the maximal time for the argument.
# Moreover, if the user will insert the words "stop" or "goodbye" you will exit the system.
# Enjoy your arguments!
